## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I used pictures in HTML to implement a mediaquery for different pictures for different screen sizes. It worked really well and I am happy about that. Learned a bit more about landmarks and still learning ACCESSIBILITY.

### Continued development

I am still learning to figure out the best way of accessibilily but its hard to do it right in small projects or maybe not? I am confused how I can do the landmarks.

### Useful resources
